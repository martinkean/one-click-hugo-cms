Occupying a small shop-front, the limited space at Mazagran Espresso Bar is filled with coffee sacks, magazines, fresh flowers and a coffee roaster. The intoxicating smell of roasting coffee wafts into the street which acts as a meeting place for shop assistants, artists and students. Selling fresh coffee and beans by the bucket load, you can choose from single variety beans or a blend. The beans are imaginatively named Mystery, Happy Honger, Brique Haus, Kick Ass and Jazz.

This hard-working little café is a hive of activity all day long and a great spot for grabbing a coffee-to-go before work. Mazagran’s is a stylish place that attracts an equally stylish crowd, yet at the same time manages to be down-to-earth. It’s the Southern way.
